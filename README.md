# NGINX Security Monitor

## Overview

NGINX Security Monitor is a Python package designed to monitor NGINX logs for potential security threats. It analyzes log data to detect attack patterns, mitigates identified threats, and triggers alerts via email and SMS. This tool can run as a standalone script or as a Linux system service for continuous monitoring.

## Features

- Parses NGINX log files to extract structured data.
- **Advanced Attack Detection**: Detects SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and suspicious user agents in real time with high accuracy and low false positives.
- **End-to-End Verification**: Includes automated test scripts to verify the complete attack detection pipeline.
- Real-time monitoring with incremental log parsing.
- Mitigates threats using appropriate tactics.
- Sends alerts through email and SMS when threats are detected.
- Runs as a Linux systemd service for production environments.
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
- **Advanced Security Features**: Encrypted pattern storage and custom plugin system to keep your specific detection rules and countermeasures private (see [Security Features](docs/SECURITY_FEATURES.md)).
- **Service Self-Protection**: Multi-layered protection against attacks targeting the monitoring service itself (see [Service Protection](docs/SERVICE_PROTECTION.md)).
- **Secure Configuration System**: Centralized configuration management with schema validation, security hardening, and environment variable overrides (see [Configuration System](docs/CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM.md)).
- **Security Framework Integrations**: Native integration with popular security tools like fail2ban, OSSEC/Wazuh, Suricata, and ModSecurity (see [Security Integrations](SECURITY_INTEGRATIONS.md)).
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 69 automated tests with 46% code coverage, including unit tests, integration tests, and mocking strategies (see [Testing Guide](TESTING.md)).

## Installation

### Quick Installation (Development/Testing)

For development and testing, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AccessiTech/nginx-security-monitor.git
cd nginx-security-monitor

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies (core + development)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For clean install (force reinstall all packages):
# pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Install in development mode (optional, for easier testing)
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: Always activate your virtual environment before running the application:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### Full Installation (Recommended for Production)

For Linux systems, use the automated installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AccessiTech/nginx-security-monitor.git
cd nginx-security-monitor

## Configuration

### Service Configuration

After installation, configure the service by editing:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/nginx-security-monitor/settings.yaml
```

The NGINX Security Monitor uses a robust configuration system with:

- **Schema-based validation**: All options validated against a custom schema
- **Built-in fallbacks**: Comprehensive built-in defaults when schema files are missing
- **Environment variable overrides**: All settings can be overridden with environment variables
- **Flexible encrypted sections**: Support for encrypted configuration data
- **Test isolation**: Singleton reset capability for reliable testing

For detailed configuration options and troubleshooting, see:

- [üìñ Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) - Complete reference of all options
- [üîê Configuration System](docs/CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM.md) - Advanced usage and best practices
- [üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting/configuration-issues.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Usage

### Service Management

- Randomized detection timing to avoid predictable patterns
- Decoy log entries to confuse potential attackers analyzing your system
- Variable detection order to make reverse engineering harder

See [SECURITY_FEATURES.md](SECURITY_FEATURES.md) for complete documentation.

**Benefits for Open Source**: Your specific detection patterns and countermeasures remain private while still using the open-source framework.

Use the management script for easy service control:

```bash
# Make management script executable
chmod +x nginx-security-monitor.sh

# Start the service
sudo ./nginx-security-monitor.sh start

# Check service status
sudo ./nginx-security-monitor.sh status

# View live logs
sudo ./nginx-security-monitor.sh logs

# Edit configuration
sudo ./nginx-security-monitor.sh config

# Restart after configuration changes
sudo ./nginx-security-monitor.sh restart
```

1. Monitor the configured log file for new entries
1. Detect security patterns in real-time
1. Send alerts when threats are detected
1. Apply configured mitigations

### Standalone Usage

To use the NGINX Security Monitor as a standalone script, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the log files.

Example usage:

```python
from nginx_security_monitor.log_parser import parse_logs
from nginx_security_monitor.pattern_detector import PatternDetector
from nginx_security_monitor.mitigation import mitigate_threat
from nginx_security_monitor.email_alert import send_email_alert
from nginx_security_monitor.sms_alert import send_sms_alert

# Parse logs
logs = parse_logs('path/to/nginx.log')

# Detect patterns
detector = PatternDetector()
detector.detect_patterns(logs)

# Mitigate threats and send alerts
for pattern in detector.get_detected_patterns():
    mitigate_threat(pattern)
    send_email_alert({'pattern': pattern})
    send_sms_alert({'pattern': pattern})
```

## Security Features

The service includes detection for:

- **SQL Injection**: Detects common SQL injection patterns in requests
