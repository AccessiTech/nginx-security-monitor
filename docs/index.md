## High-Level Overview

NGINX Security Monitor is a Python-based tool designed to monitor NGINX logs for potential security threats.
It provides real-time detection, mitigation, and alerting capabilities, making it ideal for production environments.
Key features include:

- **Threat Detection**: Identifies attack patterns such as SQL injection, XSS, DDoS, and brute force (see [Pattern Detection](PATTERN_DETECTION.md)).

- **Mitigation Strategies**: Applies countermeasures to neutralize threats (see [Mitigation Strategies](MITIGATION_STRATEGIES.md)).

- **Alerting System**: Sends notifications via email and SMS (see [Alert Systems](ALERT_SYSTEMS.md)).

- **System Integration**: Works seamlessly with tools like fail2ban, OSSEC/Wazuh, Suricata, and
  ModSecurity (see [Security Integrations](SECURITY_INTEGRATIONS.md)).

- **Advanced Security**: Includes encrypted pattern storage and a plugin system for custom rules (see [Security Features](SECURITY_FEATURES.md)).

- **Production-Ready**: Can run as a Linux systemd service with security hardening (see [Service Protection](SERVICE_PROTECTION.md)).

  > For full production security and system integration, set the following environment variable before starting the service:
  >
  > ```sh
  > export NSM_ENV=production
  > ```
