# Elite Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Nginx Security Monitor project.

## Overview

The Elite Test Coverage Plan ensures maximum code quality and reliability through:
- Unit testing with high coverage targets
- Integration testing across all components
- Performance and security testing
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

## Coverage Targets

- **Unit Tests**: 95% code coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: All major component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user workflows
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Individual function and method testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Edge case validation
- Error handling verification

### 2. Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- Database integration
- API endpoint testing
- Third-party service integration

### 3. Performance Tests
- Load testing under normal conditions
- Stress testing at peak capacity
- Memory usage profiling
- Response time benchmarks

### 4. Security Tests
- Input validation testing
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption verification
- Vulnerability scanning
